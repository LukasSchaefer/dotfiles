## MacOS Dotfiles

This contains my dotfiles including config files for **tmux**, **vimrc**, **zshrc** and aliases for zsh.

Note that my zsh-setup is based upon [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh).

Additionally this includes some small scripts based on python, applescript, zsh and shellscript.
The wallpaper changer applescript can be found [here](https://github.com/pipwerks/OS-X-Wallpaper-Changer).
